# Second order Linear Differential Equations {#sec-2ndorder}

A second order linear differential equation has the form.
\begin{equation}
  P(x)\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} + Q(x)\frac{dy}{dx} + R(x)y = G(x),
  \label{genericode}
\end{equation}
where the functions $P$, $Q$, $R$ and $G$ are specified.

For convenience, let $w$ denote $\frac{dy}{dx}$ and write the equation as
\begin{align}
  \frac{dy}{dx} &= w \\
  P\frac{dw}{dx} &= - Qw - Ry + G
\end{align}
