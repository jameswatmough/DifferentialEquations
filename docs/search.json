    "section": "1.1 Motivating examples",
    "text": "1.1 Motivating examples\nThe art of applied mathematics involves distilling a description of the state a system into relationships between variables. For example, consider a simple pendulum consisting of a mass on a rigid rod constrained to swing in a plane. The various quantities of interest are the mass, \\(m\\), the length of the rod, \\(l\\), the horizontal displacement, \\(x\\), the vertical displacement, \\(y\\), both measured, for example, relative to the fixed end of the rod, and the angle of displacement, \\(\\theta\\). These quantities are not independent. We know \\(x^2+y^2 = l^2\\), and we can choose to measure angle so that \\(x = \\sin \\theta\\) and \\(y = \\cos \\theta\\). Our description so far is static, and our equations are algebraic.\nTo describe the dynamics of the pendulum, we need to extend our mathematical description to include velocities, accelerations, forces and energies. If we neglect the mass of the rod, we can hypothesize that the component of the gravitational force perpendicular to the rod acts to accelerate the mass radially. \\[\\text{mass}\\times\\text{radial acceleration} = \\text{radial force of gravity}\\] \\[ml\\ddot{\\theta} = - m g \\sin \\theta \\tag{1.1}\\] Here \\(g\\) denotes the gravitational constant and we use the double dot notation to denote the second derivative with respect to time. If we assume the angle is small, we can approximate \\(\\sin \\theta\\) by \\(\\theta\\) and Equation Equation 1.1 simplifies to \\[ml\\ddot{\\theta} = - m g \\theta \\tag{1.2}\\]\nOur goal in this course is to understand differential equations like Equation 1.2. We’ll proceed more or less in the following order.\n\nWe’ll start with simpler first order differential equations, some of which you’ll have seen in your Calculus courses.\n\nNext we’ll look at higher order differential equations and systems of first order differential equations.\nMost of our focus will be on linear differential equations and initial value problems.\nWe’ll use Laplace transforms to handle impulsive systems, like circuits with switches.\nWe’ll briefly look at Fourier series and boundary value problems.\n\n\nExample 1.1 The motion of a mass on a spring is modelled as a balance of potential energy, \\(\\frac{1}{2}kx^2\\), which is assumed proportional to the mass’s squared displacement from an equilibrium position, and kinetic energy, \\(\\frac{1}{2}m\\dot{x}^2\\) which is assumed proportional to the mass’s squared velocity, or squared rate of change of displacement.\nConservation of energy implies the sum of these two quantities remains constant. You may have seen this expressed in terms of forces: \\(m\\ddot{x} + kx = 0\\).\nHere the displacement, \\(x\\), is our dependent variable. The independent variable, time, is implicit. We will refer to the mass, \\(m\\), and the spring constant \\(k\\) as our parameters. The differential equation is often accompanied by initial conditions. For example releasing the mass from rest with an initial displacement \\(x_0\\) translates to the conditions \\(x(0) = x_0\\), \\(\\dot{x}(0) = 0\\).\n\n\nExample 1.2 Exponential growth is modelled as a solution to the simple ode \\(y' = ry\\). More complex logistic growth is the solution to the equation \\(y' = ry(1-y/K)\\).\n\n\nExample 1.3 Conservation of charge in an electrical circuit can be modelled as constraints between voltage drops, currents and their rates of change.\n\nAn ordinary differential equation is simply an equation involving an independent variable, say \\(t\\), a dependant variable, \\(y\\), and its derivatives, \\(\\frac{dy}{dt}, \\frac{d^2y}{dt^2}, \\frac{d^3y}{dt^3}, \\dots\\) The order of a differential equation refers to the highest derivative present. For example, \\[\\frac{dy}{dt} = a\\sin(bt)y(1-y)\\] is a first order nonlinear ordinary differential equation; \\[m\\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} + r\\frac{dy}{dt} + ky = a\\cos(t)\\] is a second order linear differential equation. The term linear refers to the linear dependence of the equation on the dependant variable and its derivatives.\nA differential equation, or a system of differential equations is said to be linear if it is linear in the dependent variable(s) and their derivatives. Thus, the equation governing the motion of a damped oscillator subject to an external force \\(F\\), \\(my'' - cy' + ky = F(t)\\), is a linear second order differential equation, even if the forcing term \\(F\\) is nonlinear in the independent variable \\(t\\)."

    "section": "1.2 Linear Differential Equations",
    "text": "1.2 Linear Differential Equations\nThe main focus of this course is on linear ordinary differential equations. This is for two simple reasons: (1) the mathematical theory for nonlinear equations is built on the simpler, more complete theory for linear equations, and (2) important concepts, such as system stability and responses to perturbations, are based on linear approximations to nonlinear equations. For example, a balance of forces acting on a mass swinging on a string (a pendulum) leads to the nonlinear differential equation \\[l\\theta''(t) + g\\sin \\theta(t) = 0,\\] where \\(\\theta(t)\\) is the angular displacement of the mass at time \\(t\\), \\(l\\) is the string length and \\(g\\) is our gravitational acceleration. You should quickly verify that the constant function \\(\\theta(t) = 0\\) for all \\(t\\) is a solution to the equation. If the initial displacement is small, we expect the angle to stay close to zero. Thus we approximate the nonlinear term, \\(g\\sin(\\theta)\\), by its tangent line, \\(g\\theta\\), resulting in the more familiar linear differential equation \\[l\\theta''(t) + g\\theta(t) = 0.\\] This one we can solve almost by inspection, since we know that sine and cosine functions behave this way. Indeed, if we guess that \\(\\theta(t) = \\sin(\\omega t)\\) we can find the frequency, \\(\\omega\\), with some simple algebra: \\[\\begin{align*}\n    l\\theta''(t) + g\\theta(t) &= 0 \\\\\n    l\\frac{d^2}{d\\theta^2}\\sin(\\omega t) + g\\sin(\\omega t) &= 0 \\\\\n    -l\\omega^2\\sin(\\omega t) + g\\sin(\\omega t) &= 0 \\\\\n    \\left(-l\\omega^2 + g\\right)\\sin(\\omega t)  &= 0\n\\end{align*}\\] Thus either \\(\\sin(\\omega t) =0\\) for all \\(t\\), implying \\(\\omega = 0\\), or \\(\\omega = \\sqrt{g/l}\\). The first case is the trivial zero solution we already guessed, the second case is the natural frequency of the pendulum. We will cover this in more depth later."

We are left with \\(y\\) defined implicitly as a function of \\(x\\).\n\nDespite not being able to find an analytic expression for \\(y\\) as a function of \\(x\\) in this example, we can still make nice plots of the solutions. The trick is to notice that we can find the inverse of the solution. Several solutions are shown in Figure 2.1\n\n\nShow the code\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef inversesoln(y,c): return( np.cbrt((y*y+np.sin(y))/2 - c/2) )\ny = np.linspace(-np.pi,np.pi,100)\nfor c in np.arange(-1.2,1.2,.2):\n  plt.plot(inversesoln(y,c),y)\n\nplt.xlabel('x')\nplt.ylabel('y')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: Sample solutions for Example 2.2\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 2.3 Solve the differential equation \\(\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{x^2}{y^2}\\).\nSeparating variables and integrating leads to \\(\\frac{y^3}{3} = \\frac{x^3}{3} + C\\).

The equation is both linear and separable so we may choose either method. \\[\\begin{align*}\n   \\frac{du}{dt} &= (2+t)(1+u) \\\\\n   \\int \\frac{du}{1+u} &= \\int (2+t) \\, dt  \\\\\n   \\ln|1+u| &= 2t+\\frac{t^2}{2} + C \\\\\n   |1+u| &= A \\exp(2t+\\frac{t^2}{2}) \\\\\n   u &= -1 \\pm A \\exp(2t+\\frac{t^2}{2})\n\\end{align*}\\] Note the use of \\(\\pm\\) is not necessary. Since \\(A\\) could be positive or negative. It just serves to remind us that integration of \\(1/(1+u)\\) leads to two solutions.\n\n\nExample 2.6 Solve the differential equation \\(xy' + y = y^2\\).

These can be integrated using an integrating factor. The trick is to find a factor, \\(u\\), which turns the left hand side of the equation into the derivative of something familiar. We multiply both sides of the equation by \\(u\\), \\[u(t)y'(t) +u(t)p(t) y(t) = u(t)q(t).\\] Notice that if we can choose \\(u\\) so that \\(up = u'\\), then the left hand side is the derivative of \\(uy\\): \\[\\left(uy\\right)' = uy' +u' y = uy' +up y =  uq.\\] We can solve this with a single integration \\[\\begin{gather}\n    \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(u(t)y(t)\\right) =  u(t)q(t) \\\\\n    u(t)y(t) =  \\int u(s)q(s) \\, ds \\\\\n    y(t) =  \\frac{1}{u(t)} \\int u(s)q(s)\\, ds\n\\end{gather}\\] There is an arbitrary constant resulting from in the integration of \\(uq\\).

To make the result more readable, define \\(P(t) = \\int_{t_0}^t p(s) \\, ds\\) and take \\(u\\) as \\(u(t) = \\exp(P(t))\\). This is the solution that also satisfies \\(u(t_0)=1\\), which is convenient. Putting this together with our expression for \\(y\\), we find, in terms of \\(P\\), \\[y(t) = e^{-P(t)} \\int e^{P(s)}q(s)\\, ds\\] This is our general solution, since it still has the constant of integration hiding in the integral.

    "text": "3.1 The General Nonlinear System: Existence and Uniqueness of Solutions\nConsider a system of differential equations of the form \\(y'(t) = f(t,y(t))\\), where \\(f:{\\mathbb R}\\times{\\mathbb R}^n\\to{\\mathbb R}^n\\) and we seek a solution \\(y:{\\mathbb R}\\to {\\mathbb R}^n\\). That is, \\(y\\) is a vector, or n-tuple of functions, and the function \\(f\\) takes a vector and a real number as inputs and returns a vector as an output. The equations are often accompanied by initial conditions of the form \\(y(t_0) = y_0\\). The solution is a curve in \\({\\mathbb R}^n\\) parameterized by \\(t\\) and passing through the point \\(y_0\\).\nSufficient conditions to guarantee the existence of a unique solution through any point are that \\(f\\) be continuous in \\(t\\) and differentiable in \\(y\\). However, a weaker condition than differentiability is also known to suffice.\n\nDefinition 3.1 (Lipschitz Continuity) A function \\(f\\) is said to be Lipschitz continuous on some subset \\(U\\) of its domain if there exists a constant \\(M\\) for which \\(\\left\\|f(x)-f(y)\\right\\| < M\\left\\|x-y\\right\\|\\) whenever \\(x,y\\in U\\) with \\(x\\ne y\\).\n\nEquivalently, a function is Lipschitz continuous if the slopes of its secant lines are all bounded. For example, \\(|x|\\) is Lipschitz continuous; \\(x^{2/3}\\) is continuous but not Lipschitz since the secant lines tend towards vertical near the origin. Note, \\(x^{2/3}\\) is (locally) Lipschitz so long as the set of interest is bounded away from the origin. In one dimension, \\(\\left\\|x-y\\right\\|\\) can be assumed to be \\(|x-y|\\). In higher dimensions \\(\\left\\|\\cdot\\right\\|\\) is most often the standard Euclidian distance.\nThe classic result for the existence of solutions to our system of differential equations is as follows.\n\nTheorem 3.1 If \\(f(t,y)\\) is continuous in the independent variable, \\(t\\), and Lipschitz continuous in \\(y\\), then the initial value problem \\(y' = f(t,y)\\), \\(y(t_0) = y_0\\) has a unique solution on some open interval \\(a < t_0 < b\\).\n\nVarious proofs of the above theorem can be found in most advanced books on differential equations.\n\nExample 3.1 An example for which solutions exist, but are not unique is the simple scalar initial value problem \\(y' = y^{2/3}\\), \\(y(0) = 0\\). The function \\(y^{2/3}\\) is continuous for all \\(y\\), but has a cusp at the origin. It is not differentiable, nor is it Lipschitz continuous at the origin. Yet the differential equation is easily solved using the method of separation of variables, leading to the solutions \\(y(t) = \\frac{1}{3}(t+c)^3\\). Taking \\(c=0\\) gives a solution passing through the origin. A second obvious solution is \\(y(t) = 0\\). Moreover, we can splice these solutions together to get an infinite family of solutions to the initial value problem: \\[\\begin{equation}\n    y(t) = \\begin{cases}\n          \\frac{1}{3}(t+c_1)^3 & t < -c_1  \\\\\n          0 & -c_1 \\le t \\le c_2 \\\\\n          \\frac{1}{3}(t-c_2)^3 & t > c_2  \n           \\end{cases}\n   \\end{equation}\\] with \\(c_1\\) and \\(c_2\\) arbitrary nonnegative constants.\n\nSystems of higher order differential equations can be expressed as systems of linear equations by introducing the derivatives as new state variables.\n\nExample 3.2 Express the second order equation \\((t-3)y''(t) + t^2y'(t) + 7y(t) = f(t)\\) as a system of two first order equations.\nLet \\(z = y'\\). Then the second order equation becomes \\((t-3)z'(t) + t^2z(t) + 7y(t) = f(t)\\). This together with the definition of \\(z\\) gives a pair of first order equations. Dividing through by \\((t-3)\\) puts the system in the basic form \\[\\begin{align*}\n    y'(t) &= z(t) \\\\\n    z'(t) &=  -\\frac{t^2}{t-3}z(t) - \\frac{7}{t-3}y(t) + f(t)\n  \\end{align*}\\] The right hand side is linear, and hence differentiable, in \\((y,z)\\) and continuous in \\(t\\) on any interval bounded away from \\(t=3\\)."

To find the eigenvectors of \\(A\\) associated with \\(r_1\\) we construct and simplify\n\\[(A -r_1I) = \\begin{pmatrix} 4-2 & -4 \\\\  1 & 0-2 \\end{pmatrix}  \n               = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & -4 \\\\  1 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}\n               \\sim \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -2 \\\\  0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\] Thus the solutions to \\((A-2I)\\vec{u} = 0\\) are all multiples of \\(\\vec{u} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}.\\) This is a one dimensional subspace.

    "section": "4.1 The general theory of second order Linear Differential Equations",
    "text": "4.1 The general theory of second order Linear Differential Equations\nThe first part of this course deals with second order linear differential equations with constant coefficients. However before we zero in on solution techniques for these equations it is worthwhile to take a brief look at the more general theory.\nMany physical problems can be cast as second order differential equations of the form \\(\\ddot{x} = f(t,x,\\dot{x})\\) with \\(\\ddot{x}\\) interpreted as acceleration, \\(x\\) as position, and \\(\\dot{x}\\) as velocity. These often arise as initial value problems, when combined with initial conditions of the form \\(x(0) = x_0\\), \\(\\dot{x}(0) = y_0\\).\nSome cases appear as boundary value problems with the conditions prescribed at two different values of the independent variable. \\(x(0) = a\\), \\(x(1) = b\\).\n\n4.1.1 Differential Equations and Linear Algebra\nA second order linear differential equation has the form. \\[P(x)\\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} + Q(x)\\frac{dy}{dx} + R(x)y = G(x), \\tag{4.1}\\] where the functions \\(P\\), \\(Q\\), \\(R\\) and \\(G\\) are specified. To motivate these as linear we need to review a few concepts from linear algebra. In particular, we need to learn to view functions as vectors.\nOne key concept from linear algebra is a linear combination. Suppose \\(y_1, y_2, \\dots, y_n\\) are \\(n\\) functions defined on some interval \\([a,b]\\). For example, the set \\(1, x, x^2, x^3, x^4, x^5\\) with \\(0 \\le x \\le 1\\) is a set of 6 functions defined on the interval \\([0,1]\\). Using the jargon we learned in our first linear algebra course, we can construct any polynomial of degree 5 or lower by taking linear combinations of the 6 basis functions. Specifically, if \\(c_0, c_1, \\dots, c_5\\) be any 6 numbers, then \\(y(x) = c_0 + c_1x + \\dots + c_5x^5\\) is a polynomial. If \\(c_5\\ne0\\), \\(y\\) is a polynomial of degree 5, otherwise, it has a lower degree. We can do the same constructions for any set of functions. Given a set of functions \\(\\{y_1, y_2, \\dots, y_n\\}\\) all with the same domain, \\([a,b]\\), and a set of scalars \\(\\{c_1, \\dots, c_n\\}\\), the linear combination \\(y = c_1y_1 + \\dots + c_ny_n\\) is a function with the same domain.\nFrom our calculus course, we know that if \\(y_1, \\dot, y_n\\) are all continuous on \\([a,b]\\), then the linear combination is also continuous. In short, functions are vectors, and all the jargon we learned in linear algebra can be applied to functions.\n\nDefinition 4.1 The set of functions \\(\\{y_1, y_2, \\dots, y_n\\}\\) is said to be linearly independent if the only scalars \\(c_1,\\dots,c_n\\) for which \\(c_1y_1 + \\dots + c_ny_n = 0\\) is \\(c_1=c_2=\\dots=c_n=0\\).\n\n\nExample 4.1 To show the two functions \\(\\sin x\\) and \\(\\cos x\\) defined for \\(0 \\le x \\le \\pi\\) are linearly independent, we need to show that \\(c_1\\sin x + c_2\\cos x = 0\\) for all \\(x\\in[0,\\pi]\\) only if \\(c_1=c_2=0\\). Since \\(\\sin 0 = 0\\) and \\(\\cos 0 = 1\\), setting \\(x=0\\) implies \\(c_2=0\\). Similarly, setting \\(x=\\pi/2\\) implies \\(c_1=0\\). Hence, the two functions are linearly independent.\n\nSo why do we call Equation 4.1 a linear differential equation? It is useful to introduce a shorthand notation for the left hand side of Equation 4.1. In more advanced courses this would be introduced as a linear operator and some fancy theorems would be invoked. An operator is simply a mathematical object that maps functions to other functions in the same way the functions of first year calculus map numbers to other numbers. Suppose \\(y\\) is twice differentiable, then we can define a new function, \\(Ly\\), by \\[\\begin{equation}\n  Ly = P\\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} + Q\\frac{dy}{dx} + Ry.\n\\end{equation}\\] We use this to define the operator \\(L\\). Simply put, given a known, twice differentiable function \\(y\\), the operation \\(L\\) returns a new function which we refer to simply as \\(Ly\\). The linearity of the operator refers to the fact that \\(L\\) is a linear transformation. That is, for any two twice-differentiable functions \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) and any two real numbers (scalars) \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), \\(L(au+bv) = aLu + bLv\\).\n\n\n4.1.2 The solution set\nA solution to the second order differential equation Equation 4.1, is any twice differentiable function \\(y(x)\\) that satisfies Equation 4.1. Since we are looking for \\(y\\) as a function of \\(x\\), it makes sense to refer to \\(x\\) as our independent variable and \\(y\\) as our dependent variable. The linearity of the equation makes some more jargon from linear algebra useful. In particular,\n\n\\(P\\), \\(Q\\) and \\(R\\) are the coefficients of the equation,\nthe equation is homogeneous if \\(G=0\\),\nthe equation is nonhomogeneous if \\(G\\ne 0\\),\nthe equation is constant coefficient if \\(P\\), \\(Q\\) and \\(R\\) constants.\n\nThe right hand side, \\(G\\), is typically an applied force or current or something similar. Hence we refer to \\(G\\) as the forcing function.\nThere are two theorems that are relevant here.\n\nTheorem 4.1 If \\(y_1\\) and \\(y_2\\) are solutions of the homogeneous problem then for any constants \\(c_1\\) and \\(c_2\\), the linear combination \\(y = c_1y_1 + c_2y_2\\) is also a solution of the homogeneous problem.\n\nIn the language of linear algebra, any linear combination of two solutions is also a solution. The proof follows almost immediately from substituting the linear combination of the two solutions into the differential equation.\n\nTheorem 4.2 If \\(y_1\\) and \\(y_2\\) are two linearly independent solutions to the homogeneous problem and \\(y_p\\) is any solution to the nonhomogeneous problem, then \\(y = c_1y_1 + c_2y_2 + y_p\\) is also a solution to the nonhomogeneous problem for any constant \\(a\\).\n\nAgain, the proof is simply a matter of plugging the proposed solution into the differential equation.\n\nTheorem 4.3 If \\(y_1\\) and \\(y_2\\) are two linear independent solutions of the homogeneous problem and \\(y_p\\) is any solution to the nonhomogeneous problem, then every solution of the homogeneous problem can be written in the form \\(y = c_1y_1 + c_2y_2 + y_p\\) for some real numbers \\(c_1\\) and \\(c_2\\).\n\nIn short, this theorem states that if we can find two linearly independent solutions, then we know all the solutions to the homogeneous problem, and if we also know any one solution to the nonhomogeneous problem, we know them all. The form of the solution set should look very familiar. It has the same structure as the set of solutions to a system of linear algebraic equations.\nThe proof of this theorem is beyond the scope of this course. However, we will be able to give a sketch of the proof later in the term.\nMany of the theorems from linear algebra apply to the operator \\(L\\). We refer to \\(Ly=0\\) as the homogeneous, or complementary problem, and \\(Ly = G\\) as the nonhomogeneous problem. As with linear systems, if \\(y_p\\) is a solution to the nonhomogeneous problem and \\(y_h\\) is any solution to the homogeneous problem, then \\(y = cy_h + y_p\\) is also a solution to the nonhomogeneous problem, for any constant \\(c\\). This can be easily verified by direct substitution. Further, if \\(y_1\\) and \\(y_2\\) are both solutions to the homogeneous problem, then any function of the form \\(y = c_1y_1 + c_2 y_2\\) is also a solution to the homogeneous problem. Note the slight difference in the wording of these results from the theorems stated above. When \\(L\\) is a second order linear differential operator, such as arises from second order linear differential equation, then it can further be shown that the homogeneous problem \\(Ly=0\\) has a two dimensional solution set. That is, we can always find two linearly independent solutions, \\(y_1\\) and \\(y_2\\) and every solution to \\(Ly=0\\) can be written as a linear combination of these. This follows from a theorem for the existence and uniqueness of solutions to systems of first order differential equations, which will be sketched later in these notes.\nLater in the notes we will also encounter the eigenvalue problem \\(Ly=\\lambda y\\), where we are interested in finding values of the constant \\(\\lambda\\) for which solutions to the eigenvalue problem exist. These typically arise in boundary value problems, and the eigenvalues correspond to modes of oscillation in the physical system.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.1: Mass spring system\n\n\n\nExample 4.2 Consider the mass-spring system of Figure Figure 4.1 with a mass of \\(m\\) attached to a spring with spring constant \\(k\\). A differential equation model for the system can be obtained either by energy balance or force balance. The energy of the system is \\[\\begin{align*}\n    \\text{Total Energy} &= \\text{Kinetic Energy} + \\text{Spring Potential} \\\\\n    &= \\frac{1}{2}m\\dot{x}^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2\n  \\end{align*}\\] Differentiating and assuming the total energy is conserved (constant) leads to the second order differential equation \\(0 = m\\dot{x}\\ddot{x} + kx\\dot{x}\\) which simplifies to \\(m\\ddot{x} + kx = 0.\\) Since both \\(k\\) and \\(m\\) are positive constants, the solutions to the equation are functions whose second derivatives are negative multiples of themselves: \\(\\ddot{x} = -\\frac{k}{m}x\\). These are sines and cosines of the appropriate period: \\[x_1(t) = \\cos \\tfrac{k}{m} t, \\qquad x_2(t) = \\sin \\tfrac{k}{m} t.\\] The general solution to the differential equation is any linear combination of these two solutions: \\(x(t) = c_1\\cos \\tfrac{k}{m} t \\, + \\, c_2 \\sin \\tfrac{k}{m} t.\\)"

If we can find two such solutions, we’ve got them all!

While this it is not at all obvious why this should be a solution and how someone would come up with it, it is easy to verify that is is a solution and that \\(y_1\\) and \\(y_2\\) are linearly independent.\nWe leave it as an exercise to show, by direct substitution, that \\(y_2\\) solves Equation 4.2. That is, show that \\[a\\frac{d^2}{dx^2}\\left(xe^{rx}\\right) + b\\frac{d}{dx}\\left(xe^{rx}\\right) +cxe^{rx} = 0\\] provided \\(b^2 - 4ac =0\\) and \\(r=b/(2a)\\).\nTo show the two solutions are linearly independent, consider the combination \\[\\alpha e^{rx} + \\beta xe^{rx} = 0.\\]\nThe key concept with linear independence of functions, is that the equality must hold for all \\(x\\) in the domain of the functions. In this case, since \\(e^{rx} > 0\\), it follows that \\(\\alpha + \\beta x = 0\\), which holds only for \\(x=-\\alpha/\\beta\\). Hence the two functions are linearly independent on any interval of nonzero length, which is all we care about.\nIn summary, the general solution in case II has the form \\[y = (c_1+c_2x)e^{rx} \\] with \\(r = -b/(2a)\\).\nCase III: complex roots (\\(b^2 - 4ac < 0\\))\nIn this case, we have two complex roots, which we will express as \\(r_1 = \\alpha - \\beta i\\) and \\(r_2 = \\alpha + \\beta i\\). For those who are comfortable with complex functions, you will be happy to know that the two functions \\(e^{r_1 x}\\) and \\(e^{r_2 x}\\) are indeed linearly independent.\nThe only catch is that we started with a problem involving real variables and real functions and it would be nice to have real solutions. Fortunately, it is possible to show that the real and complex parts of the complex solutions are also linearly independent solutions.

    "section": "4.3 Finding particular solutions of the nonhomogeneous problem",
    "text": "4.3 Finding particular solutions of the nonhomogeneous problem\nThere are two textbook approaches to finding solutions to a nonhomogeneous linear problem. The first, variation of parameters, gives us a general formula for the solution that works in the constant coefficient case, and, with caveats, in the nonconstant coefficient case. The second approach, undetermined coefficients, is essentially a trick for the constant coefficient problem that works for certain forcing functions but not in general.\n\n4.3.1 Variation of Parameters\nConsider the general linear second order differential equation, \\[a(x)y'' + b(x)y' + c(x)y = g(x) \\tag{4.4}\\] The formulae we derive in this section allow \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) to depend on \\(x\\), but we’ll drop the explicit dependence in the derivations for the sake of clarity.\nBefore we derive the general formula, it’s worth looking at how we can use a solution to the homogeneous problem to simplify the nonhomogeneous problem.\nSuppose we know one solution, \\(y_1\\), to the homogeneous problem (\\(g=0\\)). We express the general solution as a product of \\(y_1\\) and another function, say \\(u\\), and derive the ODE that \\(u\\) satisfies. I.e., substitute \\(y = uy_1\\) into our nonhomogeneous problem. \\[\\begin{align*}\n  a \\left(u''y_1 + 2u'y_1'+uy_1''\\right) + b\\left(u'y_1+uy_1'\\right) + cuy_1 &= g \\\\\n  a \\left(u''y_1 + 2u'y_1'\\right) + bu'y_1 + auy_1''+buy_1' +cuy_1 &= g \\\\\n  a \\left(u''y_1 + 2u'y_1'\\right) + bu'y_1  = g\n\\end{align*}\\] On that last step, we used the fact that \\(y_1\\) is a solution to the homogeneous problem. The last few terms cancel leaving us with an equation that only involves the derivatives of \\(u\\). Although this is still a second order equation for \\(u\\), we can view it as a first order equation for \\(u'\\). To make this easier to see, gather up the coefficients of \\(u''\\) and \\(u'\\) and let \\(U = u'\\). \\[ay_1 U' + \\left(2ay_1' + by_1\\right)U  = g\\] We can solve this first order linear equation for \\(U\\), integrate \\(U\\) to find \\(u\\), and multiply by \\(y_1\\) to find a solution to the original nonhomogeneous second order problem for \\(y\\).\nNow suppose we know two linearly independent solutions, \\(y_1\\) and \\(y_2\\), to the homogeneous problem Equation 4.4 with \\(g=0\\). We can use the same idea to find a particular solution to the nonhomogeneous problem Equation 4.4. The trick is to look for a solution of the form \\(y(x) = u(x)y_1(x) + v(x)y_2(x)\\). Notice that \\(y' = u'y_1 + uy'_1 + v'y_2 + vy'_2\\). It turns out looking for two functions, \\(u\\) and \\(v\\), gives us enough freedom to choose these functions so that \\(u'y_1 + v'y_2 = 0\\). This simplifies \\(y'\\) to \\(uy'_1 + vy'_2\\), and then \\(y'' = u'y'_1 + uy_1^{''} + v'y'_2 + vy_2^{''}\\). Substituting these into our general ODE yields \\[a \\left(u'y'_1 + uy_1^{''} + v'y'_2 + vy_2^{''}\\right) + b\\left(uy'_1 + vy'_2\\right) + c\\left(uy_1 + vy_2\\right) = g\\] This looks nasty, but recognizing that \\(y_1\\) and \\(y_2\\) satisfy the ODE, it reduces to \\[au'y'_1 + av'y'_2 = g\\] Thus, we’ve converted our second order problem for \\(y\\) into a pair of first order problems for \\(u'\\) and \\(v'\\). In matrix form, the pair of equations, and their solution have a nice structure. \\[\\begin{equation}\n    \\begin{pmatrix} y_1 & y_2 \\\\ y_1' & y_2' \\end{pmatrix}\n    \\begin{pmatrix} u' \\\\ v' \\end{pmatrix}\n        =\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ \\frac{g}{a} \\end{pmatrix}\n\\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation}\n    \\begin{pmatrix} u' \\\\ v' \\end{pmatrix}\n        =\\frac{1}{a} \\begin{pmatrix} y_1 & y_2 \\\\ y_1' & y_2' \\end{pmatrix}^{-1}\n        \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ \\g \\end{pmatrix}\n\\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation}\n    \\begin{pmatrix} u' \\\\ v' \\end{pmatrix}\n        =\\frac{1}{a(y_1y_2' - y_1'y_2} \\begin{pmatrix} y_2' & -y_2 \\\\ -y_1' & y_1 \\end{pmatrix}^{-1}\n        \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ \\g \\end{pmatrix}\n\\end{equation}\\] On the right hand side we have known functions of \\(x\\). The three functions \\(a\\), \\(y_1\\), and \\(y_2\\) represent our system, and the fourth function, \\(g\\), usually represents something like an external forcing or applied voltage. We’ll see this matrix form again when we study systems of first order equations.\nThe determinant, \\(y_1y_2' - y_1'y_2\\), is known as the Wronskian. Since \\(y_1\\) and \\(y_2\\) were linearly independent, we expect this to be nonzero. This isn’t always the case, but it is likely true for most practical cases you’ll encounter.\nWe can express \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) as integrals and express the solution \\(y\\) as \\[y = -y_1\\int \\frac{y_2g}{a(y_1y_2' - y_1'y_2)}  + y_2\\int \\frac{y_1g}{a(y_1y_2' - y_1'y_2)} \\tag{4.5}\\] We’ve use the two solutions to the homogeneous problem to reduce our nonhomogeneous problem to two integrations of known functions.\n\nExample 4.3 Use the method of variation of parameters to find the general solution to \\(y'' + 9y = \\sec 3x\\).\nFirst, solve the homogeneous problem. The characteristic equation is \\(r^2+9=0\\), which has complex roots, \\(r=\\pm 3i\\). The two solutions are \\(y_1(x) = \\cos(3x)\\) and \\(y_2(x) = \\sin(3x)\\).\nSecond, compute \\(y_1'\\) and \\(y_2'\\) and set up the system for \\(u'\\) and \\(v'\\) \\[\\begin{align*}\n    u'\\cos 3x  + v' \\sin(3x) &= 0 \\\\\n-3u'\\sin 3x  + 3v' \\cos(3x) &= \\sec 3x\n\\end{align*}\\] Isolate \\(u'\\) by multiplying the first equation through by \\(3\\cos(3x)\\), the second through by \\(\\sin(3x)\\) and taking the difference of the results \\[u' = -\\frac{1}{3}\\sin(3x) \\sec(3x)\\] Similarly, we find \\[v' =  -\\frac{1}{3}\\cos(3x) \\sec(3x) = -\\frac{1}{3}\\] Integrate to find \\(u\\) begin{align} u(x) &= -(3x) (3x) , dx \\ &= -(3x) , dx \\ &= | 3x | end{align} and \\(v = \\frac{x}{3}\\)\nPutting everything together,\n\\[y(x) = c_1\\cos(3x) + c_2\\sin(3x)\n           + \\frac{1}{9}\\cos(3x)\\log | \\cos(3x) |\n                 + \\frac{1}{3}x\\sin(3x)\\]\n\n\n\n4.3.2 The method of Undetermined Coefficients\n\n\n4.3.3 Exercises\nAll the problems in Openstax Calculus Volume 3 Section 7.2 are good practice."

    "text": "4.6 Discussion\nNote that we refer to Equation 4.1 as linear when it is linear in the dependent variable. It may be nonlinear in the independent variable.

The parameters \\(L\\), \\(R\\) and \\(C\\) are the inductance, resistance and capacitance of the circuit and \\(E\\) is an applied voltage. If the fixed resistance \\(R\\) is replaced by a variable resistance, \\(R(t)\\), the equation is still linear in the dependent variable.\nMore generally, a differential equation is an equation involving a function and some of its derivatives.\nFor example, a simple model for the angular deflection \\(\\theta(t)\\) of a pendulum of length \\(l\\) is \\[l\\theta''(t) + g\\sin \\theta(t) = 0,\\] which arises from balancing kinetic and potential energies.

    "section": "5.1 Definition and basic properties",
    "text": "5.1 Definition and basic properties\nWe will see two integral transforms in this course: the Fourier Transform and the Laplace Transform. In general, an integral transform takes a function, \\(f\\), of one variable defined on an interval \\([a,b]\\), multiplies it by a kernel, \\(k\\), depending on two variables, and integrates the product over the domain \\([a,b]\\). The result is a function of the second variable appearing in the kernel: \\[F(s) = \\int_a^b k(t,s) f(t)\\, dt\\] The Laplace Transform takes a function \\(f\\) defined on \\((0,\\infty)\\) and transforms it using the kernel \\(k(t,s) = e^{-st}\\). \\[F(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} f(t)\\, dt\\] We can and will think of the transform as a function whose inputs are functions of time, and whose outputs are functions of the second variable \\(s\\). We’ll use a fancy L to denote this function. Hence, the Laplace Transform of a function \\(f\\) is the function \\(F\\) defined by \\[F(s) = {\\mathcal L}\\left\\{f\\right\\}(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}f(t)\\, dt \\tag{5.1}\\]\nIf we just want to refer to the transformed function we’ll use \\({\\mathcal L}\\left\\{f\\right\\}\\). Sometimes we’ll use the notation \\({\\mathcal L}\\left\\{f(t)\\right\\}\\), which is inconsistent with the convention that \\(f\\) refers to the function and \\(f(t)\\) refers to the function evaluated at a given time \\(t\\). However, the abuse is a convenient one, since it allows us to use \\(f(t-c)\\) to denote the time-shift of \\(f\\). Hence, depending on the context, \\(f(t-c)\\) might refer to both the shifted function or the value of the function. \n\nExample 5.1 Find the Laplace Transform of \\(e^{-at}\\) for any constant \\(a\\) \\[\\begin{align}\n  {\\mathcal L}\\left\\{e^{-at}\\right\\}(s)\n    &= \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}e^{-at}\\, dt \\\\\n    &= \\int_0^\\infty e^{-(s+a)t}\\, dt \\\\\n    &= \\left. -\\frac{1}{s+a}e^{-(s+a)t} \\right|_{t=0}^\\infty \\\\\n    &= -\\frac{1}{s+a} \\quad s+a>0\n\\end{align}\\] Note we treat \\(s\\) and \\(a\\) as constants for the integration step. Think of this as finding the Transform at a given value of \\(s\\). For this example, the integral diverges if \\(s+a\\le0\\), hence, the domain of the transformed function is \\((a,\\infty)\\).\n\nA special case of the previous example is \\({\\mathcal L}\\left\\{1\\right\\}(s) = \\frac{1}{s}\\).\n\nExample 5.2 Find the Laplace Transform of \\(t\\) \\[\\begin{align}\n  {\\mathcal L}\\left\\{t\\right\\}(s) &= \\int_0^\\infty te^{-st}\\, dt \\\\\n             &= \\left. t\\left(-\\frac{1}{s}e^{-st}\\right)\\right|_{t=0}^\\infty  - \\int_0^\\infty \\left(-\\frac{1}{s}e^{-st}\\right)\\, dt \\\\\n             &= 0  - \\left. \\frac{1}{s^2}e^{-st}\\right|_{t=0}^\\infty \\\\\n             &= \\frac{1}{s^2}, \\quad s>0\n\\end{align}\\] Note we’ve used integration by parts with \\(u = t\\) and \\(dv = e^{-st}dt\\). And again note that the integral diverges if \\(s\\le0\\).\n\n\nExample 5.3 Find the Laplace Transform of \\(t^n\\) \\[\\begin{align}\n  {\\mathcal L}\\left\\{t^n\\right\\}(s) &= \\int_0^\\infty t^ne^{-st}\\, dt \\\\\n             &= \\left. t^n\\left(-\\frac{1}{s}e^{-st}\\right)\\right|_{t=0}^\\infty  - \\int_0^\\infty \\left(nt^{n-1}\\right)\\left(-\\frac{1}{s}e^{-st}\\right)\\, dt \\\\\n             &= 0  + \\frac{n}{s}\\int_0^\\infty t^{n-1}e^{-st}\\, dt , \\quad s > 0\\\\\n             &= 0  + \\frac{n}{s}{\\mathcal L}\\left\\{t^{n-1}\\right\\}\n\\end{align}\\] Repeating this step another \\(n-1\\) times, we should arrive at \\[{\\mathcal L}\\left\\{t^n\\right\\} = \\frac{n!}{s^n}{\\mathcal L}\\left\\{1\\right\\} = \\frac{n!}{s^{n+1}}\\] Indeed, using this formula with \\(n=0\\) and \\(n=1\\) gives the same results as before.

    "section": "5.4 Impulsive forcing",
    "text": "5.4 Impulsive forcing\nWe are often interested in forcing the system with an impulse, a large force applied over a short time period. Define a unit box function, \\[\\delta_a(t) = \\begin{cases}\\frac{1}{2a}, & -a < t < a, \\\\ 0, & \\text{otherwise}. \\end{cases}\\] Note that \\(\\int_{0}^\\infty \\delta_a(t-t_o) \\, dt = 1\\) provided \\(t_o > a\\). Since we are interested in impulses over very short times (small \\(a\\)), it is natural to think of a limit as \\(a\\rightarrow0\\).\nThe limit of such a sequence of unit boxes is called the Dirac delta function. Conceptually, at least for this course, we can view it as being defined as \\[\\delta(t-t_o) = \\lim_{a\\rightarrow0} \\delta_a(t-t_0).\\] However, this limit is not a function in the sense we are used to and it is certainly not Riemann integrable. The mathematical machinery needed to make sense of this limit is outside the scope of this course. Nevertheless, the concept is interesting and turns out to be useful in practice.\nNote that \\[\\lim_{\\rightarrow0^+} \\int_{0}^\\infty \\delta_a(t-t_o)  \\, dt = 1\\] since the integral is one for every positive \\(a\\). Moreover, for any continuous function \\(f\\) defined on \\([0,\\infty)\\) \\[\\begin{align}\n  \\lim_{a\\rightarrow0^+} \\int_{0}^\\infty f(t) \\delta_a(t-t_o)  \\, dt  \n&= \\lim_{a\\rightarrow0^+} \\frac{1}{2a}\\int_{t_o-a}^{t_o+a} f(t)  \\, dt  \n&= f(t_o)\n\\end{align}\\] The unit impulses behave nicely in the limit as long as they stay inside integrals! In fact, another way to define the delta-function is by this property: \\(\\int_0^\\infty \\delta(t-t_o) f(t) \\, dt = f(t_o)\\) for every continuous function \\(f\\) and time \\(t_o \\ge 0\\).\nIn particular, \\[{\\mathcal L}\\left\\{\\delta(t-t_o)\\right\\} = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} \\delta(t-t_o)\\, dt = e^{-st_o}.\\]\nTheoretically, we’ve wandered off the edge of the map. \\(\\delta\\) is not a function in any sense we are familiar with, it’s not Riemann ingegrable, and all the previous lines are nothing more than wishful symbol manipulation. Despite this, the symbol manipulation usually turns out nicely and proves useful.\n\nExample 5.6 Solve the initial value problem \\[y'' + 9y = \\delta(t-\\frac{\\pi}{2}), \\qquad y(0) = 0, \\ y'(0) = 0.\\] Note this is the classic model for a simple pendulum starting at rest at time zero, and given a unit of force concentrated at time \\(\\pi/2\\). Think of tapping the pendulum with a hammer.\nTaking the Laplace transform of both sides yields\n\\[(s^2 + 9) Y(s) = e^{-\\pi s/2}\\] \\[Y(s) = \\frac{e^{-\\pi s/2}}{s^2 + 9}\\] and the inverse transform gives the solution \\[\\begin{align*}\n   y(t) &= \\frac{1}{3}\\sin\\left(3(t-\\pi/2)\\right) u_{\\pi/2}(t) \\\\\n        &= \\begin{cases}\n             0 & 0 \\le t < \\pi/2 \\\\\n             \\frac{1}{3}\\sin\\left(3(t-\\pi/2)\\right), & t \\ge \\pi/2.\n        \\end{cases}\n\\end{align*}\\]"
