## The usual Fourier Series for $f$


## A more general view of Fourier Series

Suppose $f$ is a piecewise continuous function defined on an interval $[-l,l]$.  
Further, suppose the set of function $\{\phi_0,\phi_1,\phi_2,\dots\}$ is orthogonal
with respect to some given inner product.  Then the fourier series for $f$ with respect
to this set is 
$\displaystyle\sum_{m=0}^\infty c_m \phi_m(x)$
with $c_m = \dfrac{\ip{f}{\phi_m}}{\ip{\phi_m}{\phi_m}}$.

The usual fourier series for $f$ is obtained when 
$\phi_n(x) = \begin{cases}    1 & m=0, \\    \cos(\frac{m\pi x}{2l}) & \text{$m$ even and positive} \\ \sin(\frac{(m+1)\pi x}{2l}) & \text{$m$ odd}  \end{cases}$
and the inner product of two functions, $u$ and $v$, is defined as 
$\ip{u}{v} = \int_{-l}^{l} u(x) v(x) \, dx$.
